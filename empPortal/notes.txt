package-lock json file

package-lock.json is automatically generated for any operations where npm 
modifies either the node_modules tree, or package.json.

angular json file 
The angular. json file at the root level of an Angular workspace provides 
workspace-wide and project-specific configuration defaults. These are used for
build and development tools provided by the Angular CLI. Path values given in
the configuration are relative to the root workspace directory.

package.json
contains descriptive and functional metadata about a project, such as a name,
version, and dependencies. The file provides the npm package manager with 
various information to help identify the project and handle dependencies

tsconfig.app.json
The app tsconfig.app.json provides the options used when working with code in 
the app folder. This allows you to further customize the options from tsconfig.json

Angular components
Components are the main building blocks for Angular applications. 
Each component consists of: An HTML template that declares what renders on the
page. A TypeScript class that defines behavior. A CSS selector that defines how 
the component is used in a template.

CSS 
Casscading Style Sheets is the standard styling language for styling language for the web

SCSS (Sassy Casscading Style Sheets) - Provides additional features such as variables, mixins and nesting


Navigation vs Routing
Routing refers to the process of mapping URLs to specific
components or views in your application. This allows users to 
navigate to different parts of your app by clicking on links or 
typing in specific URLs. (creating a path)

Navigation, on the other hand, refers to the process of moving
between these different routes or views.(Following the path)

Directives
In Angular, Directives are defined as classes that can add new 
behavior to the elements in the template or modify existing 
behavior. 

Router-Outlet
Routing refers to the process of mapping URLs to specific 
components or views in your application. This allows users to 
navigate to different parts of your app by clicking on links or 
typing in specific URLs. Navigation, on the other hand, refers to 
the process of moving between these different routes or views

ngModel 
The ngmodel directive binds the value of HTML controls 
(input, select, textarea) to application data. With the ng-model 
directive you can bind the value of an input field to a variable 
created in Angular. The binding goes both ways.

data binding
Data binding is the process that couples two data sources 
together and synchronizes them. With data binding, a change to an 
element in a data set automatically updates in the bound data set.

One way data binding (click on something and something happens)
One-way data binding in Angular (i.e. unidirectional binding) 
is a way to bind data from the component to the view (DOM) or 
vice versa - from view to the component. It is used to display 
information to the end-user which automatically stays synchronized
with each change of the underlying data.

two way data binding
The two-way data binding in Angular enables data to flow from 
the component to the view and the other way round. It is used to
display information to the end-user and allows them to make changes 
to the underlying data using the UI.

Templete Driven Forms and Reactive

Reactive Forms:

Imagine you're building a car from scratch. With reactive forms, 
you carefully plan and assemble each part of the car 
(like the engine, wheels, and chassis) in a controlled workshop 
environment. You use specialized tools and follow a precise blueprint
to ensure everything fits together perfectly. Once assembled, each part
is securely fixed, and you can monitor its performance closely. 
If you need to make adjustments or repairs, you can easily access 
and modify individual components.

Template-Driven Forms:

Now, let's consider a scenario where you're customizing a 
pre-made car model. Template-driven forms are like modifying a 
ready-made car where certain components are accessible from the 
dashboard or through visible controls (like knobs and switches).
You can change the interior settings, adjust the seat positions, 
or customize the dashboard layout directly. However, the modifications 
are somewhat limited to what the car model allows, and you rely more on 
the car's existing features and controls for adjustments.

Authentication Vs Autherization

Authentication: authentication verifies the identity of a user or service

Autherization : authorization determines their access rights.

Auth gaurds 
In Angular, Auth Guards is a technique used to protect our routes based on
user authentication status. It will manage different access levels between 
authenticated and non-authenticated users.

Allows you to protect specific routes or features in your application, ensuring that
only autherzied --- protecting specific routes(can not checkout without login in)

installing temp server for json files 
npm install -g json-server

JSON FILE 
A JSON file is a file that stores simple data structures and objects in JavaScript 
Object Notation (JSON) format, which is a standard data interchange format. 
It is primarily used for transmitting data between a web application and a server. 
JSON files are lightweight, text-based, human-readable, and can be edited using a 
text editor.

always include stuff before using them aka import

Constructor in angular 
An Angular constructor is a function that is used to initialize an Angular application.
The constructor is run when the application is first created, and it is responsible 
for setting up the Angular environment.

we should use constructor() to setup Dependency Injection, Initialization of class fields etc. 

ngOnInit(): ngOnInit is a lifecycle hook in Angular that is called after the constructor is called and 
after the component's inputs have been initialized. It is used to perform any additional initialization 
that is required for the component. ngOnInit is commonly used to call services or to set up subscriptions.

Services 
Service is a broad category encompassing any value, function, or feature that an application needs. 
A service is typically a class with a narrow, well-defined purpose. It should do something specific 
and do it well. 
Think of a customer, a chef and a waiter.

Restaurant (Angular Application):
Think of your restaurant as an Angular application. It consists of various components (like tables, kitchen,
cashier) that work together to deliver a great dining experience.

Kitchen (Service):
The kitchen in your restaurant represents an Angular service. It's a centralized place where cooking and 
food preparation happen. Similarly, a service in Angular is a centralized place for managing specific
functionalities and data operations.

Menu Items (Data):
Menu items on your restaurant's menu are like data objects or information within your Angular application. 
These could be customer orders, product listings, or any other type of data.

Chef (Component):
The chef in your kitchen represents an Angular component. Each chef (or component) has specific tasks 
(or responsibilities) such as preparing dishes, interacting with customers, or managing orders.

Order Management (Service Interaction):
When a waiter (component) receives an order (request) from a customer (user interaction), 
they communicate with the kitchen (service) to prepare the dish (process data) and serve it back to the 
customer (update the UI).

//this bit of code is within login.component.Ts
this.http.get<any>("Http...").subscribe(res =>{
    const user = res.find((details:any) => {
        return details.email === this.loginForm.value.email && details.password == this.loginForm.value
    }) ;

    if (user){
        alert("Successfully logged in")
        this.loginForm.reset();
        this.router.navigate(["Home"]) // import the router on app module TS
    }
    else {
        alertt ("You are not welcome chief!)
    }
}) , err =>
    {
        alert ("usser not found")
    }

.subscribe Listens to the get and waits for a response

any is used when you do not specify the data type eg Double, inter, string

=> - arrow function

The => operator in Angular (and in JavaScript/TypeScript) is known as the arrow function or fat arrow
function syntax. It is used to define anonymous functions or function expressions with a more concise 
syntax compared to traditional function expressions.
